RabbitMQ Tutorials 1-5 completed using VS Code Dev Containers.

Basic understanding of dev container is that in the .devcontainer file, devcontainer.json refers to docker-compose.yml, which in turn refers to Dockerfile.

Use the "postCreateCommand" property in the devcontainer.json to manage the installation of additional software (referencing the requirements.txt file).
